        <h1>Road Trips.<br><span>Adventures</span></h1>
        <p>This road trip through the northeast winds along pastoral valleys and ancient mountains connecting three dynamic cities–New York, Boston and Montreal–while passing through quaint country retreats and revived Rust Belt towns.

There are also plenty of chances to sample regional food at roadside pancake houses, soft-serve ice cream stands, lobster pounds, and seafood shacks.</p>
